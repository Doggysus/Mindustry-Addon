# Iron Mod
Мой первый мод на Mindustry прошу не судить строго)
### ![Iron Ore](https://github.com/Kitrr1x/ironMod/blob/master/sprites/items/IronOre.png) IronOre
A first tier and the main resource of the mod. You'll want to get much of it. You need a Laser/Airblast drill to mine the ore. Then you need to put the ores into the Gold Crucible to smelt your gold. Finally, you'd want to transport molten gold to the Gold Forge. Great, you've just got your first gold ingots! Use them to research and build defenses and to make ammunition for turrets!
### ![Cobalt](https://github.com/Kitrr1x/ironMod/blob/master/sprites/items/Cobalt.png) Cobalt
A second tier material of the mod. They say the recipe of this alloy is held by a very strong machine in the spore lands. It is usually used to upgrade assembled shells, make strong units and build more turrets.
